This Python code implements a Workout Routine Generator using the OpenAI API. The generator aims to provide tailored coaching advice or workout routines based on the user's skill level and goals in a specific sport.

Features:
User Interface: The program offers a simple user interface using IPython widgets for collecting user input, including name, primary sport, skill level, and goals.
Data Persistence: User data can be saved to a JSON file and loaded later for convenience.
OpenAI Integration: The generator utilizes the OpenAI API to generate workout routines based on user inputs.
Logging: Logs user interactions and errors to a log file for debugging purposes.
Usage:
Run the code in a Python environment supporting IPython widgets.
Enter your name, primary sport, skill level, and goals in the provided fields.
Click the "Submit" button to generate a workout routine based on your inputs.
Optionally, you can load and save your data using the respective buttons.
Use the "Plot User History" button to visualize your skill level over time if you have previous entries.
Requirements:
Python environment with IPython widgets support.
OpenAI API access (requires an API key).
Matplotlib library for plotting (install via pip if not available).
Repository Structure:
workout_generator.py: Main Python script implementing the workout routine generator.
workout_data.json: JSON file to store user data.
workout_generator.log: Log file capturing user interactions and errors.
